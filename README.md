# MINIMARKET-CHASIER-SYSTEM
## Project Overview
The Minimarket Cashier System is a desktop-based cashier application developed using Python as a Final Semester Exam (UAS) project.  
The application is designed to assist cashier activities in a minimarket, including managing product data and handling transactions with persistent data storage.

---

## Objectives
- Implement a simple cashier system using Python
- Apply SQL-based database concepts using SQLite
- Perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Build a desktop GUI application using Tkinter

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **GUI Framework:** Tkinter  
- **Database:** SQLite  
- **Database Library:** sqlite3  
- **Supporting Data File:** CSV  

---

## System Architecture
- **Frontend:** Tkinter (desktop graphical user interface)
- **Backend:** Python application logic
- **Database:** SQLite file-based SQL database (`.db`)

CSV files are used as supporting or initial data sources and are not the main database.
